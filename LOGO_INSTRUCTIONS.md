# Logo and Favicon Instructions

To complete the GPTZero styling, you need to add two image files to your project:

1. Save the blue circular GPTZero logo to your project as:
   - `public/logo.png` (for the header logo) 
   - `public/favicon.ico` (for browser tab favicon)

The blue circular logo should match the one from the image you shared.
